## Core Values

Our seven core values guide every decision, from product development to customer interactions:

### 1. Developer-Centric Design

**Principle**: Developers are our primary users, and their experience drives every product decision.

- **Developer First**: Features are evaluated based on direct developer impact before business metrics
- **Minimal Friction**: Every interaction should be intuitive, fast, and productive
- **Respect Developer Time**: Never waste a developer's time with unnecessary complexity or bureaucracy
- **Continuous Feedback**: Regular user research, beta programs, and feedback loops

**In Practice**:
- New features validated through developer beta programs before general release
- CLI-first design philosophy (developers work in terminals)
- Comprehensive documentation with runnable examples
- Active engagement in developer communities (GitHub, Discord, Stack Overflow)
- No dark patterns or manipulative UX

### 2. Trust & Transparency

**Principle**: We earn trust through transparency in our operations, pricing, and data practices.

- **Clear Communication**: Honest about capabilities, limitations, and roadmap
